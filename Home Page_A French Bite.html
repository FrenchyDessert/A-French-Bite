		<h2>Some history about French patisserie.</h2>
		
		<p>French patisserie has a rich history, beginning in the Middle Ages with simple pastries made by monks and nuns in monasteries. These early treats were made from basic ingredients like almonds, honey, and fruits. Over time, French pastries evolved, with significant milestones including the invention of puff pastry in the 17th century and the influence of the French Revolution, which led many royal pastry chefs to open their own shops and introduce new techniques.</p>

		<p>The development of French patisserie was shaped by cultural influences, with the Moors introducing sugar and almonds, and the Renaissance bringing ingredients like chocolate and coffee to France. More recently, globalization has led to a fusion of traditional French pastries with international flavors.</p>

		<p>Notable pastry chefs like Auguste Escoffier, Pierre Hermé, and Christophe Michalak have further elevated French patisserie, each contributing innovative techniques and flavors. Traditional French treats such as croissants, macarons, and éclairs remain beloved around the world, with modern trends focusing on innovative flavor combinations, health-conscious options, and sustainability practices.</p>

		<p>The history of French patisserie is a testament to artistry and craftsmanship, evolving from simple beginnings into sophisticated, indulgent treats enjoyed globally. Each pastry tells a story of tradition, creativity, and passion, continuing to captivate taste buds and inspire chefs today.

		<p class="thoughts">In this website, I present some of the most popular and classic , yet easiest desserts of the French patisserie.Some that can be made at home by anyone who wishes to. I hope this website to motivate people to make those desserts for themselves and their families, make the ones who are too scared to try because they think it is too complicated realize that it is in fact not! I say this with confidence because I am making them at home and I have yet to have a bad review from my family and friends, they always like what I make, so why can’t someone else accomplish the same?  I want people to read a recipe on this site and feel confident that they can make it.</p>
