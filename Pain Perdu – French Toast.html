		<p>Pain perdu, literaly "Lost Bread", known as French toast, is mostly considered a breakfast consisting of bread soaked in beaten eggs and milk then fried.</p>
		<p>This dish gained its name because it was traditionally made using stale bread that would have otherwise been discarded. In medieval times, French toast was a luxurious dish, enjoyed solely by the wealthy upper classes.</p>

				<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
					<ul>
						<li> 3/4 cup whole milk or half-and-half</li>
						<li> 3 large eggs</li>
						<li> 4 tablespoons granulated sugar, divided</li>
						<li> 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
						<li> Pinch of salt</li>
						<li> 4 (3/4-inch thick) slices day-old brioche bread</li>
						<li> 2 cups strawberries</li>
						<li> 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
						<li> 2 tablespoons sliced almonds, preferably toasted</li>
						<li> Powdered sugar, for dusting</li>
					</ul>
				
				
				<h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Mix the whole milk (or half-and-half), the eggs, 2 tablespoons of the granulated sugar, the vanilla extract, and the pinch of salt together. Whisk until smooth and combined.</li>
						<li> Pour the mix  in a 9x13-inch baking dish or other shallow baking dish large enough to hold the brioche in a single layer.</li>
						<li>Add the 4 slices of brioche in a single layer and turn to coat. Let soak 5 minutes. Flip the brioche and let soak until all the liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes more. Meanwhile, trim and thinly slice 2 cups strawberries. Place in a medium bowl, sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, and toss to combine.</li>
						<li>Melt 1 tablespoon of the unsalted butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add 2 brioche slices and cook until the bottoms are golden-brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until second side is golden-brown, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to plates. Repeat with the remaining 1 tablespoon unsalted butter and brioche slices.</li>
						<li>Spoon the strawberries over the pain perdu and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons sliced almonds if desired. Dust with powdered sugar. Honestly you can add a good scoop of vanilla ice cream, caramel sauce, chocolate sauce, any raw fruits desired. From this point on it is customizable to your taste.</li>
