		<p>Chocolate mousse is made with the best quality of chocolate someone can find, it is rich, decadent, not too sweet, and addictive enough. One of the best yet easiest French desserts.</p>
		<p>Chocolate mousse is believed to have originated in France in the 18th century. It is said that the dessert was first created by a French chef named Menon in the early 1700s. It was first known as "mayonnaise de chocolat". </p>

				<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>	
					<ul>
						<li> 3 egg yolks</li>
						<li> 2/3 cup sugar, sifted</li>
						<li> 1/2 cup milk</li>
						<li> 8 ounces dark chocolate, between 60 and 80% cacao for a strong taste, roughly chopped</li>
						<li> 2 cups heavy cream, cold</li>
					</ul>
	
	
				<h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Using a hand mixer, cream the egg yolks and 1/3 cup of sugar until pale and fluffy. Put aside.</li>
						<li>In a saucepan, over medium heat, combine the milk and the remaining 1/3 cup of sugar. Once it begins to simmer and the sugar is dissolved, remove from heat and pour a small amount in the creamed yolks, whisking constantly so you don't end up with sweet scrambled eggs. Once the creamed yolks are tempered, add it to the saucepan and bring it back to the stove.</li>
						<li>Continue cooking, stirring constantly, until it thickens slightly and the custard coats the back of a spoon and a line drawn with your finger comes clean. Put aside.</li>
						<li>Melt the chocolate by placing it in a medium sized bowl and putting it in the microwave. Heat it on medium high for about 1 minute, then remove from the microwave and stir. Repeat heating at shorter intervals of 15 seconds, stirring in between, until the chocolate is completely melted and smooth. Alternatively, you can melt it in a double boiler on your stove.</li>
						<li>Combine the melted chocolate and the custard.</li>
						<li>Using your hand (or stand) mixer, whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form.</li>
						<li>Add 1/3 of the whipped cream to the chocolate/custard batter and whisk by hand, vigorously, until combined. Then, gently fold in the remaining whipped cream, making sure not to deflate the mousse.</li>
						<li>Transfer the mousse to a large serving dish or individual glasses and refrigerate for at least one hour to set.</li>
						<li>Serve it cold! I like to add more whip cream at the top, you can decorate with some shaved dark chocolate as well, nd strawberries or even raspberrys.</li>
