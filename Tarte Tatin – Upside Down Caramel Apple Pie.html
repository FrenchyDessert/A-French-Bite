	<div class="description">
		<p>The tarte Tatin is a quintessential French dessert which is essentially an upside-down caramel apple tart, sometimes considered a cake.​</p>
		<p>It was named after the Tatin sisters who invented it and served it in their hotel as its signature dish. It is said that this classic was created by accident; one of the sisters had supposedly put the apples to bake while forgetting to put the dough first and added it on top of the apples in the middle of the baking process.</p>

				<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
	
				<p>FOR THE PASTRY DOUGH</p>
					<ul>
						<li> 1 sheet of pie dough or puff pastry dough, thawed, better with puff pastry</li>
					</ul>
	
				<p>FOR THE APPLE LAYER</p>
					<ul>
						<li> 5-6 medium Granny Smith apples</li>
						<li> 2/3 cups granulated sugar</li>
						<li> 1/3 cup water </li>
						<li> 5 tbsp unsalted butter </li>
						<li> 1/4 tsp table salt </li>
						<li> vanilla ice cream to serve with, optional</li>
					</ul>
		
	
				<h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Preheat the oven to 375°F. Prepare the apples by peeling them, and then cutting them into thirds, or quarters depending on the size of your apples. Don't forget to discard the cores.</li>
						<li>Pour the sugar into a 10-inch skillet over medium heat, dispersing the sugar all over the bottom of the pan. Add in the water. DO NOT STIR. Let the sugar dissolve in the water and bubble until the mixture turns a light amber color. This will take about 6 to 10 minutes, so keep an eye on the sugar and lower the heat a bit if it seems like it's browning too quickly.</li>
						<li>Slide the skillet off the heat temporarily and sprinkle in the salt. Add the unsalted butter, and then move the skillet back over to medium-low heat. Use a wooden spoon to stir the butter in until it's melted. Your caramel may clump or seize; this is OK as it will dissolve again once it's getting hot again over the stove. The cold butter does this to the caramel.</li>
						<li>Add the apples into the caramel and cook for about 10 to 15 minutes, until the apples are tender. Be sure to stir the caramel and apples every minute or so.</li>
						<li>Meanwhile, roll out your pie dough or puff pastry dough to elongate it a bit to ensure it can cover the diameter of your 10 inch-skillet.</li>
						<li>Once the apples are tender, use two forks to help you flip each apple wedge over so that the cut side is facing up. Arrange the apples in a radial pattern.</li>
						<li>Center the pastry dough over the skillet and place on top of the apples to completely cover all the apples. Tuck the edges of dough into the skillet, under the apples, using a spoon.</li>
						<li>Bake the tart for approximately 35 to 40 minutes, rotating the tart halfway through. Once the pastry is golden, remove the tart and let it rest for a few minutes. Grab a serving plate that's large enough to cover the entire skillet and place it upside down on top of the skillet. Flip the skillet (and essentially the tart) over onto the plate. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.</li>
